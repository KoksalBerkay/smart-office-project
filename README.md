# Smart Office Project

## Overview

The **Smart Office Project** aims to create an energy-efficient and comfortable work environment for SMEs, workplaces, and laboratories. It monitors temperature, lighting, and inactivity, allowing remote management via a mobile app. The project seeks to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency at a low cost.

## Project Objective

The primary goal is to implement a smart system that:

- Monitor environmental parameters.
- Transmit and back up data to a central server.
- Enable remote control via a mobile application.
- Automate responses to environmental changes to reduce energy consumption.
- Provide a cost-effective solution for workplace efficiency.

## Technical Details

### Components

- **DHT Temperature and Humidity Sensor**: Measures ambient temperature and humidity levels.
- **LDR Light Sensor**: Monitors ambient light levels.
- **PIR Motion Sensor**: Detects motion within the environment.
- **Relay Modules**: Controls circuits to manage connected devices.
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Operates the sensors and connects to the internet.
- **Raspberry Pi 3**: Functions as an MQTT server and database, handling data from sensors and communicating with the mobile application.

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Sensors connected to the ESP32 microcontroller gather data on temperature, humidity, light, and motion.
2. **Data Transmission**: Collected data is encrypted and sent via Wi-Fi to an MQTT server hosted on the Raspberry Pi using the MQTT protocol.
3. **Data Processing**: The server processes the data, compares it to threshold values set in the mobile application, and issues commands to control connected devices.
4. **User Interface**: The mobile application, developed with the Flutter framework, allows users to monitor and manage environmental parameters remotely.

### Security

- **Unique IDs**: Communication between the ESP32 and the MQTT server is secured using unique 16-character hexadecimal IDs generated by the ESP32.
- **Bluetooth Configuration**: Initial setup involves Bluetooth communication between the mobile app and the ESP32 to configure Wi-Fi credentials and server details.
- **Secure Communication**: Post-setup, all communication is handled securely over Wi-Fi with unique IDs ensuring safe data transmission.

## Results

- **Mobile Application**: A Flutter-based application enabling easy remote management.
- **MQTT Server**: A robust server setup on Raspberry Pi to handle data and commands.
- **Sensor Network**: An efficient sensor network for real-time monitoring of environmental parameters.

## Future Improvements

### Phase Two: Artificial Intelligence

- **AI Integration**: Implementing AI to analyze employee habits and automatically adjust environmental settings for optimal comfort and efficiency.
- **Enhanced Automation**: Enabling the system to make autonomous decisions based on predictive analytics, such as adjusting lighting or temperature based on usage patterns.

## Conclusion

The Smart Office Project successfully demonstrates a cost-effective and efficient approach to creating a smart office environment. The ongoing development and future integration of AI will further enhance its capabilities, making it a comprehensive solution for modern workplaces.
